# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized for easy navigation and reference.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number in the `solutions/` directory:

```
solutions/
├── 0001-two-sum/
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── solution.java
│   └── README.md
├── 0002-add-two-numbers/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

Each problem has its own directory named with the format: `{problem_number}-{problem-name}/`

- Solution files in one or more programming languages
- `README.md` with problem description, approach, and complexity analysis

## Languages

Solutions may be provided in:
- Python
